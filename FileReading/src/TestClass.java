	My school is pretty dark for most of the year, except
	in late October. dusty cobwebs appear in the hallway, with 
	really gray dismal hanging from them. The lunch
	room has >orange and black skeleton everywhere, and they
	serve roasted <part of the body> for lunch. Someone told
	me that a giant ghost clown took over the principal's
	office.  All of the teachers look different; one is a zombie
	with pumpkin hair, another is a candy scary and I think my <school
	subject> teacher is a scream now. Tombstones line the hallways, and one said "Here lies <name
	of someone in the room>, who died of <verb -ing>.
